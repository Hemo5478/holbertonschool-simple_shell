# Simple Shell

## ðŸ“ƒDescription

This repository aims to write a simple UNIX command interpreter in **C** that reads commands from either a file or standard input and executes them as part of the low-level programming track at Holberton School.
 

## ðŸ›  Usage 
In order to run this program you need to follow the instructions below :

1. Clone this repository :

``` 
git clone https://github.com/Hemo5478/holbertonschool-simple_shell
```

2. Access the project directory :
```
 cd holbertonschool-simple_shell
```

3. Compile all .c files in the direcotory :

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
``` 

4. Run the resulting executable by invoking the program in the interactive mode : 

``` 
$ ./hsh
```
5. Exit the program by typing :
``` 
($) exit
```
6. You can also run the program in the non-interactive mode with the following command : 
``` 
   $ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
 ```  




## Requirements 
### General :

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* Your shell should not have any memory leaks
* No more than 5 functions per file
* All your header files should be include guarded
Use system calls only when you need to (why?)
